On the diagram relay 0 is connected to valve 1. So for the ADAM 192.168.70.1
we have the following: 0a is valve 1, 1a is valve 2, ... , 5a is valve 6. For
ADAM 192.168.70.2: 0b is valve 7, 1b is valve 8, 2b is valve 9 and 3b is valve
10. For channels 4b and 5b we don't have yet the valves, those will be out of
the panel. 


Regarding the pressure sensors: valve 9 go with pressure sensor 1 (TS1), valve
8 with sensor 2 (TS2), valve 6 with sensor 3 (TS3, that is the big
thermosyphon), valve 7 with sensor 4 (TS4) and valve 10 with sensor 5 (TS5). 


The channels of ADAM-6024 are connected in the following way: pressure sensor
1 is on AI0, sensor 2 is on AI1, sensor 3 is on AI2, sensor 4 is on AI3,
sensor 5 is on AI4 and flow meter is on channels AI5 and AO1. 


Also, valve 3 is connected to the pump and valve 4 is only for vent.
