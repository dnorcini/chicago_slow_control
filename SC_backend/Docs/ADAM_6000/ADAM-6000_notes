The code assumes the ADC ranges for the 6024 and 6017 are +-10V.  
You'll have to use a conversion factor if you set them to another range.

The DAC on the 6024 is by default a current (mA) source.  You must open
the module and change the jumpers to set it as a 0-10V voltage source.

For ADCs, the conversion is:
    	  display (real units) = parm1 + readout(V) * parm2 + readout(V)^2*parm3

For ADCs, the conversion is:
    	  output(V) = parm1 + setval(real units) * parm2 +  setval(real units)^2 * parm3
	  if parm4 is > 0, then output (in V) is limited to parm4.

The RTDs in the 6015 readout assume -200 to 200 C range for PT100.
